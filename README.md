# Pseudo Ecommerce

This Project was made to simulate an Ecommerce site.

It was made using react, bootstrap, font awesome and styled components.

The code use a .json object to get the products info and use the context API to provide a global state for the code.

In the app, users can:

- Sort items by price, score and alphabetical order.
- Add and remove items from the cart.
- See shipping and total value on the cart page.
